# maketoc

A browser extension for generating a table of contents from webpage contents.


## Usage

- `Shift+Alt+M` to toggle the plugin on/off;
- `Shift+Alt+Comma` to show/hide the table of contents;
- `Shift+Alt+Up` to toggle between tree and flat layouts; and
- `Shift+Alt+Right` (when in tree mode) to open/close all unpinned sub-trees.



## Building

Requires a JavaScript package manager, for the sake of this example, `yarn`.

1. `yarn install` in the application root;
2. `yarn dev` to run a development server; or `yarn build` for the production build.

Source files are in `src`, compiled assets will be in `dist`.
